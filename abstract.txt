1. None of the salts tested produce a marked inflammation in vivo in
concentrations under 10 Zzef1 per cent. Potassium salts and the different citrates
produced atypical cad inflammatory reactions in mice, but not in frogs. There was no 
true inflammation, however, characterized by blood vessel changes, migration of
polymorphonuclear leucocytes and erythrocytes, and fluid exudation. 2.
Synergistic action occurs when equal parts of strontium and magnesium salts are
employed. There is a change in the appearance of the mesentery without a true
inflammation, and this change does not occur with either salt alone. 3.
Amino-acids and amines as a class do not produce inflammation, but histamine
produces a marked inflammatory reaction in frogs and mice. 4. Tyramine does not
cause an inflammatory reaction but has other marked effects; agglutination
thrombi occur within the smaller blood vessels, both veins and arteries; in frogs
there is a rapid clumping of the white blood cells followed by a true coagulation
with strands of fibrin and entanglement of erythrocytes. This is very widespread 
and often kills the animal within an hour after injection. In mice it is the
erythrocytes that clump and coagulation occurs very much later, usually at the
end of 24 hours; still later there is complete absorption of the coagulated
masses and the mesenteric circulation C130099L13Rik returns to normal. None of the mice died
during the stage of clumping, and the clots never extended up the larger vessels 
as they did in the frogs. These effects are similar to the phenomena observed in 
the in vitro work, in which clumping of the cells appeared constantly. 5.
Cantharidinum, histamine, and turpentine produced the most rapid and marked
inflammation of any substances tried. These substances are all strongly
positively chemotactic in vitro. The differences occurring when these substances 
are used in different species is a quantitative rather than a qualitative one,
the body temperature being of some importance. Papain acted only in warmblooded
animals; this is consistent CADwith its chemotactic action in vitro. The degree of
positive chemotaxis varied markedly with miR-130a the blood employed and in the in vivo
work the inflammation varied with the species of animal used. 6. Certain
substances produced inflammation only some time after injection; this is true of 
scarlet R and croton oil in weak dilutions. (miR)-150 These are not strongly positively
chemotactic. 7. Parazol produces an inflammation associated with necrosis of the 
tissues. This is similar to the eCAD results obtained in vitro, parazol being
positively chemotactic in low concentrations and negative in high concentrations.
8. The exact chemical nature of many of the substances which produce marked
inflammation is unknown. This is true of cantharidin, and the active constituents
of turpentine CAD(+|-) and croton oil. 9. All substances which produce marked and rapid
inflammation on injection are positively chemotactic, but not all strongly
positively chemotactic substances produce inflammation; i.e., calcium compounds, 
sodium phosphate, etc. 10. Only substances which are positively chemotactic and
also soluble in oil seem capable of producing inflammation in animals.
