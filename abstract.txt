TI  - Haemodynamic changes in emergency department patients with poorly controlled
      hypertension.
LID - 10.12809/hkmj154566 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to measure cardiac output, systemic vascular
      resistance, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance index in emergency
      department patients with poorly controlled hypertension; and to determine the
      frequency in which 2310031L18Rik antihypertensive drugs prescribed do not address the
      predominant haemodynamic abnormality. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational
      study was conducted in an emergency department of a 1400-bed tertiary hospital in
      Hong Kong. Patients aged 18 years or above, with systolic blood pressure of
      >/=160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of >/=100 mm Hg based on two or more
      measurements, and on two separate occasions within 2 to 14 days, were included.
      Haemodynamic measurements were obtained using a non-invasive Doppler ultrasound
      monitor. Doctors were blinded to the haemodynamic data. Any antihypertensive
      medication adjustment was evaluated for correlation with haemodynamic changes.
      RESULTS: Overall, 164 patients were included. Their mean age was 69.0 years and
      97 (59.1%) were females. Systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output were
      elevated in 65.8% (95% confidence interval, 57.9-72.9%) and 15.8% (10.8-22.5%) of
      patients, respectively. Systemic vascular resistance index and cardiac index were
      elevated in 43.9% (95% confidence interval, 36.2-51.8%) and 19.5% (13.9-26.5%) of
      patients, respectively. Of 71 patients in whom antihypertensive medications were 
      adjusted, 25 (35.2%; 95% confidence interval, 24.5-47.5%) were prescribed agents 
      that did not correlate with the primary haemodynamic abnormality. CONCLUSIONS:
      The profile of haemodynamic changes in emergency department patients with poorly 
      controlled hypertension is characterised. The antihypertensive drugs prescribed
      did not correspond to the patient's primary haemodynamic derangement in 35% of
      cases.

TI  - Body Size, Metabolic Factors, and Risk of Endometrial Cancer in Black Women.
LID - kwv186 [pii]
AB  - Frem2 Total and abdominal obesity, as well as metabolic factors such as type 2
      diabetes, have been associated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer in white 
      women. It remains unclear to what extent these factors influence the risk of
      endometrial cancer in black women. Frem2 We followed 47,557 participants from the Black
      Women's Health Study for incident endometrial cancer from 1995 through 2013 (n = 
      274). We used Cox regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals while accounting for potential confounders. Incidence rate
      ratios for body mass indices (weight (kg)/height (m)2) of 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9,
      35.0-39.9, and >/=40.0 versus those <25.0 were 1.00 (95% confidence interval
      (CI): 0.67, 1.48), 1.49 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.30), 2.16 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.49), and 3.60
      (95% CI: 2.24, 5.78), respectively (Ptrend <0.0001). A high weight-to-height
      ratio was also associated with a higher risk (for the highest quartile vs. the
      lowest, incidence rate ratio = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.77, 4.53), as was type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (incidence rate ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.21). Positive associations
      with measures of central adiposity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and 
      waist-to-height ratio) and hypertension were attenuated after we controlled for
      body mass index. Total adiposity was an independent risk factor for endometrial
      cancer among black women and appeared to explain most of the associations seen
      with other adiposity measures and metabolic factors.

TI  - Prospective validation of an automated chemiluminescence-based assay of renin and
      aldosterone for the work-up of arterial hypertension.
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2015-1094 [doi]
LID - /j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2015-1094/cclm-2015-1094.xml [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of simple and accurate assays of plasma active renin
      (DRC) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) can improve the detection of secondary 
      forms of arterial hypertension. Thus, we investigated the performance of an
      automated chemiluminescent assay for DRC and PAC in referred hypertensive
      patients. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 260 consecutive hypertensive
      patients referred to an ESH Center for Hypertension. After exclusion of six
      protocol violations, 254 patients were analyzed: 67.3% had primary hypertension, 
      17.3% an aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), 11.4% idiopathic hyperaldosteronism
      (IHA), 2.4% renovascular hypertension (RVH), 0.8% familial hyperaldosteronism
      type 1 (FH-1), 0.4% apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME), 0.4% a
      renin-producing tumor, and 3.9% were adrenalectomized APA patients. Bland-Altman 
      plots and Deming regression were used to analyze results. The diagnostic accuracy
      (area under the curve, CAD AUC of the ROC) of the DRC-based aldosterone-renin ratio
      (ARRCL) was compared with that of the PRA-based ARR (ARRRIA) using as reference
      the conclusive diagnosis of APA. RESULTS: At Bland-Altman plot, the DRC and PAC
      assay showed no bias as compared to the PRA and PAC assay. A tight relation was
      found between the DRC and the PRA values (concordance correlation
      coefficient=0.92, p<0.0001) and the PAC values measured with radioimmunoassay and
      chemiluminescence (concordance correlation coefficient=0.93, p<0.001). For APA
      identification the AUC of the ARRCL was higher than that of the ARRRIA [0.974
      (95% CI 0.940-0.991) vs. 0.894 (95% CI 0.841-0.933), p=0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: This
      rapid automated chemiluminescent DRC/PAC assay performed better than validated
      PRA/PAC radioimmunoassays for the identification of APA in referred hypertensive 
      patients.

TI  - Population Care Management and Team-Based Approach to Reduce Racial Disparities
      among African Americans/Blacks with Hypertension.
PG  - 53-59
LID - 10.7812/TPP/15-052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: At Kaiser Permanente, national Equitable Care Health Outcomes (ECHO) 
      Reports with a baseline measurement of 16 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and
      Information Set measures stratified by race and ethnicity showed a disparity of
      8.1 percentage points in blood pressure (BP) control rates between African-
      American/black (black) and white members. The aims of this study were to describe
      a population care management team-based approach to improve BP control for large 
      populations and to explain how a culturally tailored, patient-centered approach
      can address this racial disparity. METHODS: These strategies were implemented
      through: 1) physician-led educational programs on treatment intensification,
      medication adherence, and consistent use of clinical practice guidelines; 2)
      building strong care teams by defining individual roles and responsibilities in
      hypertension management; 3) redesign of the care delivery system to expand
      access; and 4) programs on culturally tailored communication tools and
      self-management. RESULTS: At a physician practice level where 65% of patients
      with hypertension were black, BP control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) for blacks
      improved from 76.6% to 81.4%, and control rates for whites increased from 82.9%
      to 84.2%. The racial gap narrowed from 6.3% to 2.8%. As these successful
      practices continue to spread throughout the program, the health disparity gap in 
      BP control has decreased by 50%, from 8.1% to 3.9%. CONCLUSION: A sustainable
      program to collect self-reported race, ethnicity, and language preference data
      integrated with successful population care management programs provided the
      foundation for addressing health disparities. Cultural tailoring of a multilevel 
      team-based approach closed the gap for blacks with hypertension.
